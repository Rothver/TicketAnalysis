# TicketAnalysis
Program made to aid with employee evaluation

A majority of the files have been uploaded. I have left out the html interpreter that is mentioned in the code, as that is information that is private to where I work.
The rest of the files pretain to handling the data put into a ticketobject (extension of the base ticket). These will be saved information that can either be saved intermitantly or pushed to a csv as the final step of the program.

Work on this has been put on hold due to class work and a shift in how evaluations are handled. May resume at a later date.
